# Contributing to the Firewall Deployment Repository

## Overview

This repository centrally manages GCP firewall rules for nonroutable service projects. Each team must provide its own configuration—including the specific project and VPC—to deploy firewall rules in their designated project.

## Directory Structure

- **configs/**: Contains team-specific JSON configuration files (e.g., `team-a.json`, `team-b.json`).  
  **Important:** Each file must include:
  - `"project"`: The GCP project ID for the team.
  - `"vpc"`: The VPC name (or self-link) where the firewall rule should be applied.
  - Firewall rule settings under `"ingress"` and `"egress"`.
- **modules/firewall/**: Contains the reusable Terraform module for creating firewall rules.
- **main.tf**: Loads all team JSON configurations and uses them to instantiate firewall rules.
- **.github/**: Contains CODEOWNERS and CI/CD workflow configuration.
- **docs/**: Contains documentation and contributing guidelines.

## Adding a New Team

1. Create a new JSON file (e.g., `team-c.json`) under **configs/**:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "team-c",
     "project": "team-c-project-id",
     "vpc": "team-c-vpc",
     "ingress": {
         "protocol": "tcp",
         "ports": ["80", "443"],
         "source_ranges": ["0.0.0.0/0"],
         "target_tags": ["team-c-web"]
     },
     "egress": {
         "protocol": "tcp",
         "ports": ["8080"],
         "destination_ranges": ["10.0.1.0/24"],
         "target_tags": ["team-c-app"]
     }
   }
